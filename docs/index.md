# dataprocessor Provider

The Data processor provider is used to process data in a simple and clean way inside terraform code
to avoid HCL over-engineering and use proper tools for this specific purpose like JQ or Go plugins.

Normally this provider will be used to to convert Json processing, raw strings, filtering, create data
structures... without messing in unreadable HCL code.

## Terraform cloud

The provider is portable and doesn't depend on any binary, so its compatible with terraform cloud workers.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    dataprocessor = {
      source = "slok/dataprocessor"
    }
  }
}

data "dataprocessor_jq" "test" {
  input_data = <<EOT
    {"timestamp": 1234567890,"report": "Age Report","results": [{ "name": "John", "age": 43, "city": "TownA" },{ "name": "Joe",  "age": 10, "city": "TownB" }]}
  EOT

  query = "[.results[] | {name, age}]"
}

output "test_jq" {
  test = jsonencode(dataprocessor_jq.test.result)
}
```
